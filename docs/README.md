We've put together a range of documentation to help you get started. 

If you want to learn how: 

- Any.sender works under the hood, check out [Contracts](https://github.com/PISAresearch/contracts.any.sender) and [Guarantees](./guarantees.md). 
- To get started with the any.sender client & depositing funds, check out [API](./API.md) and [Client library](./client.md).
- To build using any.sender via an example, check our receipes [Simple echo](./echoRecipe.md) and [Ballot voting](https://github.com/stonecoldpat/anysender-voting)

Finally, if you don't want to use our client library, you can also check out our super-simple [API](./API.md)
